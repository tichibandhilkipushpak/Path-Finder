Finding Shortest Path from Patient to the Plasma donor
Built a web application using React.js that can find the Shortest Path between covid-patient and the
nearest plasma donor. During "Novel Corona Virus 2019" many patients died because of not getting
plasma at the right time. This web application ensures that it will give the shortest path.
This web application uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path.

Exposure: Data Structures and Algorithms, Javascript, React.js, HTML/CSS (Animations).
